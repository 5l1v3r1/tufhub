# tufhub
tufhub is a hacking framework
thats filled with all kinds of
tools that you use directly
in the script i coded it specificly
for the actual kali linux os so if
your running it with cmd you have no
chance if running it with windows store
kali linux some stuff works and some not
and on real kali os it will work the best
please tell me if theres an issue / error
in the script because theres probably alot
